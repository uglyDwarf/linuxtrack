The second step to take is to select the "model" to use. Model is a "marker", attached to ones head,
simplifying the head pose determination.

<p>
There are two predefined models "NP TrackClip" and "NP TrackClip Pro" - if you use one of those,
just select it using the <b>Model Name</b> combobox.

<p>
If you use any other model, you'll have to create it first. Just press the <b>Create New</b> button
and the form for new model creation will pop up.

<p>
Type in the name of your model to the <b>Model Name</b> box and then select the model type. 
Available model types are these:
 <ul>
   <li><b>1 point</b> - single LED diode or reflective marker, simple but gives you only 2 degrees of freedom (pan)</li>
   <li><b>3 point Cap</b> - three LEDs or reflective markers, for example on the top of your cap; 
       provides 6 degrees of freedom</li>
   <li><b>3 point Clip</b> - three LEDs or reflective markers, for example on the side of your headset;
       provides 6 degrees of freedom</li>
 </ul>

<p>
Now fill in the model dimensions according to the diagram (all dimensions are in milimeters).
Last thing to do is to select, if the model uses LEDs - if it does, check the <b>Model with LEDs</b> checkbox.
After pressing the <b>Create</b> button, the new model should appear 
in the <b>Model Name</b> combobox for you to select it.
